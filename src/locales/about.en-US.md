title: "Who am I and what do I do."
---

I am a developer and that lives in Copenhagen. I have a huge passion for my craft. <br><br>

In 2011 I discovered that it's possible to develop mods for Minecraft. <br><br>

From that day I was hooked on software. Though for the majority of my life I have been obsessed with technology. <br><br>

After some years of small mods for some different games, I got my eyes on business-programming.
There I decided to start an education as datatechnician with special in programming on TEC. That education was not for
me so I started on HF so I could start on computer science on CPHBusiness. I am happy I did that. <br><br>

I am very dedicated to software development and I am very interested in bigger projects. <br><br>

I value my social life, and when I don't write code, I use my time on friends and family. <br><br>
